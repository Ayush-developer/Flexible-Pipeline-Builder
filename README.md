#Flexible-Pipeline-Builder
> A dynamic pipeline builder with React and FastAPI for Node Abstraction, Styling, Backend Integration, and DAG Analysis.

---

## üöÄ Features  

1. **Node Abstraction:**  
   - Simplified node creation with a reusable abstraction for inputs, outputs, LLMs, and text nodes.  
   - Added 5 custom nodes to demonstrate flexibility.  

2. **Dynamic Styling:**  
   - Designed a unified and visually appealing interface with custom React styling.  

3. **Enhanced Text Node Logic:**  
   - Auto-resizing nodes based on text input.  
   - Variable handling with dynamic Handle generation using double curly brackets (e.g., `{{ variable }}`).  

4. **Backend Integration:**  
   - Seamless integration with a Python/FastAPI backend.  
   - Calculates number of nodes and edges in the pipeline and verifies if it's a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).  
   - Frontend alert system to display backend responses.
